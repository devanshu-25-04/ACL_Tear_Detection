# ACL Tear Detection Using Deep Learning

### ACL Tear Detection Using Deep Learning is a project aimed at developing a computer vision-based system to detect Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears in medical images. The project utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to assist medical professionals in diagnosing ACL tears accurately and efficiently.

## Introduction
### Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears are common injuries in the field of sports medicine, and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to build a reliable ACL tear detection system. By automating the detection process, medical professionals can make faster and more precise diagnoses, leading to better patient outcomes.

## Dataset
### The dataset used for training and evaluating the deep learning model consists of annotated medical images of knee joints. The images are collected from various sources, including MRI scans and X-rays, and are labeled as either "Healthy" or "ACL Tear" by medical experts.

## Features
### Deep learning-based ACL tear detection system.
### Preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality and reduce noise.
### Model evaluation and validation on a test dataset.
### User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing medical images.
### Detailed diagnostic report with confidence scores for ACL tear detection.
